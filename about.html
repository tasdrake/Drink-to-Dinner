          People usually think to choose a drink based on what they are eating, but what do you eat with that special bottle you have been saving?  Drink to Dinner offers a new way to look at food and drink parings.  The goal is to find recipes that will pair well with a specific bottle of wine or beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot of science around food and drink pairing, but it is important to drink what you enjoy.  There are two types of pairings to consider: mirroring and contrasting.  Mirroring uses similar flavors in the drink and the food to improve upon the flavor of the dish.  Contrasting finds differences that complement each other without masking other flavors in the food or drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          When looking to contrast food and drink pairings it is best to use acidity or even carbonation.  Fatty foods tend to be the best to contrast because the acidity helps to clear the mouth of the fat.  Carbonation increases the acidity of a liquid, thus making beer a complimentary contrast to pair with fatty meats.

          Sweet flavors are present in many foods, and can drastically change the flavor of a drink.  When eating foods that have a sweet sauce or component, it is important to mirror that sweetness in the drink.  But itâ€™s only a little sweetness that is necessary in the drink, otherwise it could mask flavors in the food.
