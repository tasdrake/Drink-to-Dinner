Drink to Dinner
=====

Drink to Dinner is built on the idea that consumers can base a meal off of a drink of choice, rather than picking the meal first and then finding a drink to compliment the food.  Think of the hobby of wine collecting or simply buying a certain bottle of wine or beer for a special occasion.  In these instances, one should be able to cook a meal based on the flavors, tones, and body of the fine wine (or beer). This website allows an individual to do just that. This page was built with mobile device access in mind using Bootstrap 4 and works on both mobiles and desktops.

1. To start out, choose either beer or wine as your drink of choice. Then select the type of beer or wine that you are drinking. Finally, to receive pairing ingredients, select an ingredient that you want to feature in your dish.
