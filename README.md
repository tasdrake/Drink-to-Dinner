Drink to Dinner
=====

Drink to Dinner is built on the idea that pairing food and drinks is not only one way. People associate paring with eating a food and choosing the right drink for that food. I want users to be able to do the opposite.  Many people have wines stored that they are saving for a special occasion, and they should be able to create a meal based on their drink. I built the page using Bootstrap 4 and thinking about mobile first, so it works on both mobile and desktop.

1. To start out, choose if you are drinking a beer or a wine. Then select the type of beer or wine that you are drinking. Finally, to receive pairing ingredients, select an ingredient that you want to feature in your dish.

2. Select other ingredients that pair well with your first choice and search for recipes containing all or some of the ingredients.

3. Scroll through the results until you find a recipe that is intriguing.

4. You can look at the ingredients needed to make each recipe and some more information about it before deciding to make that recipe.

I hope you enjoy finding recipes and making delicious meals to pair with your drink.
